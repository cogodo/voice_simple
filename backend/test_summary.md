# Unified TTS Pipeline Test Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. **Unified Pipeline Implementation**
- ✅ **Conversation Auto-TTS**: Now emits `start_tts` event (same as test button)
- ✅ **Voice Auto-TTS**: Now emits `start_tts` event (same as test button)  
- ✅ **Legacy Support**: Added `synthesize_speech_streaming` handler that routes to `start_tts`

### 2. **Code Structure Improvements**
- ✅ **Function Accessibility**: Moved `_trigger_auto_tts` to module level for testing
- ✅ **Event Handler Registration**: All expected TTS events properly registered
- ✅ **Consistent Event Flow**: All TTS triggers use identical pipeline

### 3. **Logic Verification (WITHOUT Server)**
- ✅ **Conversation Auto-TTS Logic**: Verified emits correct `start_tts` event
- ✅ **Voice Auto-TTS Logic**: Verified emits correct `start_tts` event
- ✅ **TTS Event Handlers**: Verified all expected events registered
- ✅ **Unified Pipeline Logic**: All tests pass - pipeline is truly unified

## 📋 PIPELINE FLOW (Now Unified)

### Test Button Flow:
```
Flutter: startTTS() → start_tts event → tts_started → pcm_frame events → tts_completed
```

### LLM Response Flow (FIXED):
```
LLM Response → _trigger_auto_tts() → start_tts event → tts_started → pcm_frame events → tts_completed
```

### Voice Response Flow (FIXED):
```
Voice Input → LLM Response → _trigger_auto_tts() → start_tts event → tts_started → pcm_frame events → tts_completed
```

**✅ ALL THREE FLOWS NOW USE IDENTICAL PIPELINE**

## 🧪 TESTING STATUS

### Logic Tests ✅ PASSED
- [x] Conversation auto-TTS emits `start_tts`
- [x] Voice auto-TTS emits `start_tts`  
- [x] TTS event handlers registered correctly
- [x] Pipeline logic is unified

### Integration Tests ⏳ PENDING SERVER
- [ ] Full end-to-end test button functionality
- [ ] Full end-to-end LLM response with TTS
- [ ] Full end-to-end voice conversation with TTS
- [ ] Audio quality comparison between test and LLM

## 🎯 EXPECTED RESULTS

With the unified pipeline implementation:

1. **Test Button Audio**: Clear, no crackling (already working)
2. **LLM Response Audio**: Should now be identical quality to test button
3. **Voice Response Audio**: Should now be identical quality to test button

The crackling/static issue should be **RESOLVED** because all audio now goes through the exact same `start_tts` → `pcm_frame` pipeline.

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Start Backend Server**: `python app.py`
2. **Run Server Check**: `python check_server.py`
3. **Run Full Integration Test**: `python test_unified_pipeline.py`
4. **Test in Flutter App**: Compare audio quality between test button and LLM responses

## 📂 TEST FILES CREATED

- `test_pipeline_logic.py` - Logic verification (no server needed) ✅
- `test_unified_pipeline.py` - Full integration test (requires server)  
- `check_server.py` - Server status checker
- `.agent_rules.md` - Project rules and preferences

## 🔧 KEY CHANGES MADE

1. **`backend/websocket/conversation_events.py`**:
   - Moved `_trigger_auto_tts` to module level
   - Changed to emit `start_tts` instead of custom events

2. **`backend/websocket/voice_events.py`**:
   - Updated `_trigger_auto_tts` to emit `start_tts` instead of custom events

3. **`backend/websocket/tts_events.py`**:
   - Added `synthesize_speech_streaming` handler for legacy support
   - Routes legacy calls to standard `start_tts` pipeline

## 💡 CONFIDENCE LEVEL: HIGH

The logic tests confirm that the unified pipeline is correctly implemented. The crackling issue should be resolved since all audio sources now use identical event flow and timing.
