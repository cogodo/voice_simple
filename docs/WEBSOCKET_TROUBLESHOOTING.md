# WebSocket Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Summary
- **Error**: `Connection error: {msg: websocket error, desc: null, type: TransportError}`
- **Target**: `http://localhost:8000`
- **Context**: Flutter web app trying to establish websocket connection
- **Platform**: Web (Chrome)

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Backend Service Analysis
- [ ] Check if backend service is running on port 8000
- [ ] Verify backend websocket endpoint configuration
- [ ] Check backend dependencies and setup
- [ ] Validate backend websocket implementation

### 2. Frontend Configuration Analysis
- [ ] Locate websocket connection code in Flutter app
- [ ] Check if endpoint URL is hardcoded or configurable
- [ ] Verify websocket client implementation
- [ ] Check for environment-specific configurations

### 3. Network and Port Analysis
- [ ] Verify port 8000 is available
- [ ] Check for firewall or security restrictions
- [ ] Test basic connectivity to localhost:8000
- [ ] Validate websocket protocol (ws vs wss)

### 4. Development Environment Setup
- [ ] Check if backend startup scripts exist
- [ ] Verify all required services are documented
- [ ] Test backend service independently
- [ ] Validate frontend-backend integration steps

### 5. Code Investigation Areas
- [ ] `lib/` directory for websocket client code
- [ ] Configuration files (pubspec.yaml, environment files)
- [ ] Backend directory for websocket server implementation
- [ ] Documentation for service dependencies

## Investigation Results

### Backend Analysis
Status: [x] Completed
Findings: 
- Backend is a Python Flask-SocketIO application in `/backend/app.py`
- Configured to run on port 8000 (default) via `/backend/config/settings.py`
- Backend websocket events are properly implemented in `/backend/websocket/` directory
- Backend is NOT currently running

### Frontend Analysis  
Status: [x] Completed
Findings:
- Frontend automatically connects to websocket on app initialization
- Connection happens in `_initializeServices()` method in `VoiceConversationScreen`
- Hardcoded to connect to `localhost:8000` in line 42 of voice_conversation_screen.dart
- WebSocket service is properly implemented with comprehensive event handlers

### Network Analysis
Status: [x] Completed
Findings:
- No service running on localhost:8000
- Backend service needs to be started before frontend can connect
- Connection protocol is correct (http://localhost:8000 for SocketIO)

### Resolution Steps
1. Start the Python backend service on port 8000
2. Verify backend websocket endpoints are accessible
3. Test frontend connection after backend is running

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Backend service starts successfully
- [x] Frontend connects to websocket without errors
- [x] Full integration test passes
- [x] Web platform works as expected 

## âœ… **RESOLUTION STATUS: COMPLETED**

### Issue: WebSocket Connection Fails on Web Platform
**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ **RESOLVED**

**Final Solution Applied**:
1. **Fixed Flutter WebSocket Configuration**: Updated transport protocols to `['polling', 'websocket']` for web browser compatibility
2. **Enhanced Backend SocketIO**: Added web-specific configurations (`threading` mode, proper CORS, logging)
3. **Fixed TTS Function Parameters**: Corrected `my_processing_function_streaming()` call to match function signature
4. **Upgraded OpenAI Client**: Updated from v1.3.7 to v1.82.0 to fix client initialization
5. **Added Missing Timestamp Method**: Added `get_current_timestamp()` to ConversationManager class

**Final Test Results**:
- âœ… WebSocket connection established successfully
- âœ… Conversation system initialized: "Conversation ready: ready"
- âœ… TTS system working: Text-to-speech requests processed
- âœ… Voice system activated: "Voice conversation mode activated"
- âœ… AI conversation working: Questions being processed

### Web Platform Status
The Flutter web app now successfully:
1. Connects to the backend websocket on localhost:8000
2. Initializes all conversation and voice systems
3. Processes text-to-speech requests
4. Handles AI conversation interactions
5. Supports voice conversation mode

**Web browser compatibility confirmed** âœ…
