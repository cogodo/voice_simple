# Voice Agent Application Architecture

## Overview

The Voice Agent is a real-time voice conversation system that enables natural speech-based interactions with AI. The application consists of a Python Flask-SocketIO backend that orchestrates multiple AI services and a Flutter mobile frontend that provides an intuitive voice interface.

## Core Architecture

### High-Level System Design

The application follows a client-server architecture with real-time bidirectional communication:

**Frontend (Flutter Mobile App)**
- Captures user voice input through device microphone
- Streams audio data to backend via WebSocket
- Receives and plays AI-generated speech responses
- Displays conversation history in chat interface
- Handles text input as fallback option

**Backend (Python Flask-SocketIO Server)**
- Manages WebSocket connections for real-time communication
- Orchestrates three main AI services: Speech-to-Text, Language Model, and Text-to-Speech
- Maintains conversation context and session state
- Streams audio responses back to clients in real-time

**External AI Services**
- OpenAI Whisper API for speech transcription
- OpenAI GPT models for conversation intelligence
- Cartesia API for high-quality voice synthesis

## Application Flow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Text-Only Conversation
This is the simplest interaction mode where users type messages directly.

**User Journey:**
1. User types a message in the Flutter app
2. Message is sent to backend via WebSocket
3. Backend forwards message to OpenAI GPT for response generation
4. AI response is sent back to Flutter app
5. Response appears in chat interface

**Backend Processing:**
- Conversation manager maintains message history for context
- Each user message and AI response is stored in conversation memory
- System prompt guides AI to provide concise, conversational responses
- Error handling ensures graceful degradation if AI service fails

### Pattern 2: Voice-to-Text-to-Voice Conversation
This is the full voice conversation mode that provides the most natural interaction.

**User Journey:**
1. User taps microphone button and speaks
2. Voice is captured and streamed to backend
3. Speech is transcribed to text via Whisper
4. Text is processed by GPT for intelligent response
5. AI response is converted to speech via Cartesia
6. Speech audio streams back to user's device for playback

**Detailed Backend Processing:**

**Voice Input Phase:**
- Audio chunks are received and accumulated in session buffer
- Multiple audio formats are supported (WAV, WebM, MP3)
- Audio is preprocessed for optimal Whisper performance (mono, 16kHz)
- Complete audio is sent to OpenAI Whisper for transcription

**Conversation Processing Phase:**
- Transcribed text is added to conversation history
- Conversation manager generates contextually appropriate response
- Response considers previous messages for coherent dialogue
- AI is prompted to keep responses concise for voice interaction

**Voice Output Phase:**
- AI response text is sent to Cartesia for speech synthesis
- Audio is generated in real-time streaming format
- Raw PCM audio chunks are streamed to client
- Client receives 20-millisecond audio frames for smooth playback

### Pattern 3: Direct Text-to-Speech
This mode allows users to hear any text spoken without AI processing.

**User Journey:**
1. User types text and requests speech synthesis
2. Text is sent directly to Cartesia for voice generation
3. Generated speech streams back to user's device

## Core Components Deep Dive

### WebSocket Event System

The application uses a sophisticated event-driven architecture with specialized handlers:

**Conversation Events:**
- Handle text-based interactions with AI
- Manage conversation history and context
- Coordinate between user input and AI response generation
- Automatically trigger speech synthesis for AI responses

**Voice Events:**
- Manage voice recording sessions and audio buffering
- Process audio chunks for real-time or batch transcription
- Handle voice input cancellation and error recovery
- Bridge voice input to conversation processing pipeline

**TTS Events:**
- Stream text-to-speech audio in real-time
- Manage audio frame timing and synchronization
- Handle client-specific audio streaming sessions
- Provide heartbeat mechanism for connection monitoring

### Session Management

**Voice Sessions:**
Each connected client gets a dedicated voice session containing:
- Audio chunk buffer for accumulating voice input
- Recording state tracking
- Whisper handler instance for transcription
- Session-specific error handling

**Conversation Context:**
- Global conversation manager maintains dialogue history
- Each message (user and AI) is stored with timestamps
- System prompts guide AI behavior for voice interactions
- Conversation can be cleared while preserving system context

### Audio Processing Pipeline

**Input Audio Processing:**
- Supports multiple audio formats from different devices
- Automatic format detection and validation
- Audio preprocessing for optimal transcription quality

## Configuration and Environment

### Environment Variables
The application uses environment-based configuration for:
- API keys for external services (OpenAI, Cartesia)
- Server settings (host, port, debug mode)
- Audio processing parameters
- Model selection and behavior tuning

### Modular Configuration
- Development, production, and testing configurations
- Automatic environment detection
- Configuration validation on startup
- Graceful handling of missing configuration

## Security and Privacy

### API Key Management
- Environment variable storage for sensitive credentials
- No hardcoded secrets in source code
- Configuration validation ensures required keys are present

### Session Isolation
- Each client connection gets isolated session data
- Audio buffers are client-specific
- Automatic cleanup on client disconnect

- Audio data is processed in memory when possible
- Temporary files are cleaned up automatically
- No persistent storage of conversation data
- Client-server communication over secure WebSocket

## Performance Optimizations

### Real-Time Audio Streaming
- **20-millisecond audio frames** with precise timing control for low latency
- **Timing-controlled frame delivery** prevents audio underruns and buffer starvation
- **Pre-collection and scheduled streaming** ensures frames arrive at exactly the right intervals
- **Optimized buffer management** to prevent dropouts and overlapping audio
- **Background task processing** for non-blocking operations
- **Client-specific streaming** to prevent cross-talk between multiple connections

### Audio Timing Control System
The application implements a sophisticated timing control system to prevent audio underruns:

**Frame Pre-Collection:**
- Audio frames are collected from Cartesia before streaming begins
- This allows for precise timing control and prevents real-time generation delays
- Eliminates timing variations from external API responses

**Real-Time Frame Delivery:**
- Each 20ms audio frame is delivered at precisely 20ms intervals
- System calculates expected delivery time for each frame
- Automatic delay insertion when frames would be sent too early
- Prevents overwhelming client audio buffers

**Underrun Prevention:**
- Consistent frame timing eliminates audio gaps and stuttering
- Prevents playback ratio issues (audio playing faster than expected)
- Eliminates overlapping audio from concurrent streams
- Provides smooth, continuous audio playback experience

**Session Management:**
