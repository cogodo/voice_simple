# Voice Agent Backend Rules

## Package Management
- **ALWAYS use `uv` instead of `pip`** for package installations
- **ALWAYS add newly installed packages to `requirements.txt`** immediately after installation
- Use `uv add <package>` to install and automatically update requirements
- Use `uv sync` to install from requirements.txt

## Backend Server
- **Assume the backend server is ALWAYS running** - do not start/stop it
- The server runs on `http://localhost:8000`
- If connection fails, focus on fixing the client/test code, not server startup
- Server logs and errors should be checked separately if needed

## Testing Workflow
1. Install test dependencies with `uv`
2. Update requirements.txt
3. Run tests assuming server is active
4. Fix issues in the code, not server management

## File Organization
- Tests go in the `tests/` directory when possible
- Standalone test scripts can be in the root backend directory
- Always clean up temporary test files
