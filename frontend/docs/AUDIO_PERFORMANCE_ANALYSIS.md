```

**Reception Analysis**:
- **Reception Rate**: 100% (106/106 frames received)
- **Processing Rate**: 99.1% (105/106 frames played)
- **Buffer Utilization**: Fluctuates between 0-5 frames (0-100ms)
- **Status**: ✅ Excellent reception, ⚠️ buffer management issues

### **Real-Time Playback Metrics**
```
📊 Buffer: 0f (0ms) | Rx: 25.0 fps | Tx: 25.0 fps | Underruns: 2
📊 Buffer: 0f (0ms) | Rx: 32.5 fps | Tx: 32.5 fps | Underruns: 7  
📊 Buffer: 3f (60ms) | Rx: 34.3 fps | Tx: 33.3 fps | Underruns: 10
```

**Playback Analysis**:
- **Average Rx Rate**: 30.6 fps (increasing over time)
- **Average Tx Rate**: 30.3 fps (slightly behind reception)
- **Buffer Levels**: Frequently at 0ms (starvation)
- **Underrun Progression**: 2 → 7 → 10 (accelerating)

## 🚨 UPDATED Root Cause Analysis: Real Stutter Sources

### **❌ Previous Analysis Was Wrong**
My initial "fixes" made the stuttering worse by:
- Reducing throughput (5→2 frames per cycle)
- Adding excessive 50ms delays
- Slowing down the timing loop

### **🔍 Real Potential Stutter Causes**

#### **1. Web Audio API Scheduling Gaps**
```dart
// PROBLEM: Fixed scheduling can create micro-gaps
final playTime = math.max(currentTime, _nextPlayTime);
_nextPlayTime = playTime + duration; // ❌ Can create cumulative timing drift
```

**Issue**: Even tiny scheduling gaps (1-2ms) are audible as clicks/stutters.

#### **2. PCM Frame Boundaries** 
```dart
// PROBLEM: Combining arbitrary PCM chunks can create discontinuities
combinedAudio.setRange(offset, offset + chunk.length, chunk);
```

**Issue**: If PCM samples don't align perfectly at chunk boundaries, you get audio "pops" where waveforms discontinue abruptly.

#### **3. Timer Precision Jitter**
```dart
Timer.periodic(Duration(milliseconds: 16), ...) // ❌ Not precise enough
```

**Issue**: Dart timers can have 1-5ms jitter, causing irregular scheduling that creates stutters.

#### **4. Float32 Conversion Artifacts**
```dart
floatArray[i] = signedSample / 32768.0; // Potential precision loss
```

**Issue**: Converting PCM→Float32→WebAudio might introduce quantization artifacts.

## 🎯 NEW Stutter Elimination Strategy

### **Fix 1: Seamless Audio Scheduling**
```dart
// IMPROVED: Eliminate scheduling gaps
if (_nextPlayTime <= currentTime) {
  _nextPlayTime = currentTime + 0.010; // Minimal delay only when needed
}
_nextPlayTime += duration; // Seamless continuation
```

### **Fix 2: PCM Boundary Smoothing** (Future)
```dart
// TODO: Add crossfading between chunks to eliminate discontinuities
```

### **Fix 3: Higher Precision Timing** (Future)
```dart
// TODO: Use requestAnimationFrame or high-resolution timers
```

### **Fix 4: Direct Buffer Management** (Future)
```dart
// TODO: Use ScriptProcessorNode for sample-accurate timing
```

## 📊 Current Hypothesis Testing

The **real test** is whether the improved scheduling logic eliminates stutters:

**Before**:
```dart
final playTime = math.max(currentTime + 0.050, _nextPlayTime); // ❌ Big gaps
_nextPlayTime = playTime + duration; // ❌ Drift accumulation
```

**After**:
```dart
if (_nextPlayTime <= currentTime) {
  _nextPlayTime = currentTime + 0.010; // ✅ Minimal catch-up
}
_nextPlayTime += duration; // ✅ Seamless continuation
```

**Expected Result**: Stutters should be reduced because audio chunks now schedule seamlessly without gaps or excessive delays.

## 🧪 Validation Metrics

Look for these improvements in the next test:

### **Timing Precision**
```
// New detailed logging:
🎵 Played 5 frames (25 total), buffer: 15f (300ms), scheduled: 1.234s, current: 1.220s
```

### **Seamless Scheduling**
- `scheduled` time should advance smoothly
- Gap between `current` and `scheduled` should stay minimal (10-50ms)
- No large jumps or delays in scheduling

### **Buffer Behavior**
- Buffer should fluctuate but not hit 0ms frequently  
- Underruns should remain low (the original 10 wasn't terrible)
- Audio should sound smooth despite occasional underruns

**Key Insight**: The original performance (105/106 frames, 10 underruns) was actually quite good. The stutters likely come from **scheduling precision** rather than buffer management.

## 🔧 Implementation Priority

### **Phase 1: Quick Wins (Immediate)**
1. Reduce frames consumed per cycle: 5 → 2
2. Increase playback loop interval: 16ms → 25ms  
3. Add 50ms scheduling buffer for Web Audio API

### **Phase 2: Buffer Management (Short-term)**
1. Implement adaptive buffer thresholds
2. Add buffer level monitoring and warnings
3. Smooth buffer transitions

### **Phase 3: Advanced Optimization (Future)**
1. Dynamic frame consumption based on buffer level
2. Jitter buffer for network resilience
3. Quality vs latency trade-off controls
