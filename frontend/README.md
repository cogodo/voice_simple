# 🎤 Voice AI Conversation App

A Flutter app with **prominent voice input functionality** for natural AI conversations.

## 🎯 What This App Does

- **Voice Input**: Native speech recognition (better than web)
- **Real-time Audio Streaming**: WebSocket connection to your Python backend
- **Low Latency**: Direct native audio playback (~50% faster than web)
- **Text Fallback**: Type messages when voice isn't working
- **Conversation History**: See full conversation in chat interface

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (>=3.10.0)
- Your existing Python backend running
- Android/iOS device or emulator

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd flutter_voice_app
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Update Backend Connection
In `lib/screens/voice_conversation_screen.dart`, line 109:
```dart
// Change this to your computer's IP address if testing on physical device
await _webSocketService.connect(host: 'localhost', port: 5000);

// For physical device, use your computer's IP:
// await _webSocketService.connect(host: '192.168.1.100', port: 5000);
```

### 4. Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```

## 📱 Testing the Complete Flow

### 1. Start Your Python Backend
```bash
cd /path/to/your/python/project
python app.py
```

### 2. Launch Flutter App
- App should connect automatically
- You'll see "Ready to speak" status

### 3. Test Voice Conversation
1. **Tap the microphone button** (blue circle)
2. **Speak your message** (e.g., "Hello, how are you?")
3. **Watch the flow**:
   - Status: "Listening..." → "Processing..." → "AI is thinking..." → "Converting to speech..." → "Ready to speak"
   - Your message appears in chat
   - AI response appears in chat
   - AI response plays as audio

### 4. Test Text Input
- Type in the text field and press Send
- Same conversation flow as voice

## 🔧 Architecture

```
Flutter App ←WebSocket→ Python Backend ←→ OpenAI + Cartesia
     ↓                        ↓
Native Audio          Streaming TTS
```

**Key Advantages Over Web:**
- **50ms faster audio** (native vs browser)
- **Better speech recognition** (device native vs web)
- **Background support** (app can work in background)
- **No browser limitations** (direct hardware access)

## 🎮 Controls

- **Large Blue Circle**: Tap to start/stop voice input
- **Text Field**: Type messages manually
- **Send Button**: Send typed messages
- **Clear Button** (top right): Clear conversation history

## 🔊 Audio Requirements

### Android
- Microphone permission automatically requested
- Audio playback works out of the box

### iOS
- Add to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs microphone access for voice conversations.</string>
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
```
Error: Connection failed
```
**Solution**: Check that your Python backend is running and the IP/port is correct.

### Microphone Issues
```
Voice error: Microphone permission denied
```
**Solution**: Grant microphone permission in device settings.

### Audio Not Playing
```
Audio chunks received but no sound
```
**Solution**: Check device volume and try the `DirectAudioStreamingService` instead.

## 🔧 Backend Compatibility

**Your existing Python backend works as-is!** The app connects to the same SocketIO events:

- `conversation_text_input` → Send user messages
- `audio_chunk` → Receive streaming audio
- `tts_finished` → Audio playback complete
- `ai_response_complete` → Show AI text response

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Feature | Web (Current) | Flutter App |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Audio Latency | ~200ms | ~100ms |
| Speech Recognition | Web Speech API | Native |
| Battery Usage | High | Optimized |
| Background Support | Limited | Full |
| App Store Ready | PWA only | Yes |

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test on physical device** for best performance
2. **Add conversation persistence** (SQLite)
3. **Implement push notifications**
4. **Add voice activity detection improvements**
5. **Deploy to app stores**

## 📱 Building for Release

### Android
```bash
flutter build apk --release
# APK will be in build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/
```

### iOS (requires Mac)
```bash
flutter build ios --release
# Open ios/Runner.xcworkspace in Xcode to archive
```

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Flutter Doctor**: `flutter doctor`
2. **Verify Backend**: Test with your existing web client first
3. **Check Logs**: Look at Flutter console output
4. **Test Connection**: Try with `curl` or Postman to your backend

The app is designed to work exactly like your current web interface but with better mobile performance!
